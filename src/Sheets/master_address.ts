/*
Assumptions made while creating this sheet:
1. We received the Mapping Template file, which had all keys within []. We removed those from the keys of each field.
2. We received the keys of each field, but not the label. Every label defined in this sheet is an assumption of what labels are supposed to be.
3. All fields are marked as TextField, except where we determined with 100% confidence the field is of other type (based on received sample data).
4. MAT Mapping Template file states that gisID should be required if GIS Flags. We need more context on this. Until then, field is marked as NOT required.
